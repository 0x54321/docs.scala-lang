In the next lesson you’ll see a primary tool for writing parallel and concurrent applications, the Scala `Future`.

This page used to be referred to as a “Concurrency Signpost,” because it introduced Akka actors and Scala futures. The actors’ lessons have been removed, but it still seems like the book needs a little transition to this new section, which is why this page is still here.
