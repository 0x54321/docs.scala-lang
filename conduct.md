title: The Scala Code of Conduct
---

This Code of Conduct covers our behaviour as contributors/comitters of
the Scala Team, as well as those participating in any Scala moderated
forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, hackathon, public
meeting or private correspondence.  (See the
[list of community fora](http://www.scala-lang.org/community/)
on the main Scala site.)

Scala moderators are appointed by EPFL / Typesafe to maintain the
health of the community and will arbitrate in any dispute over the
conduct of a member of the community.

Note: This should not be interpreted like a legal document.  It's a statement
of intent, and a guideline for collaboration.

The code of conduct consists of a few simple rules:

## (1) Be Respectful

The Scala community is made up of a diverse set of individuals and
backgrounds. Everyone can make a contribution to Scala. Disagreement is no
excuse for poor behavior. Also, many users coming to Scala might have
different background than others. Not knowing a particular domain is not just
cause for rude behavior. If someone is suggesting concepts
that go beyond your basic understanding, patiently asking for more information
is the right way to go. Treat each other with respect in all interactions.

A few examples for clarification.

Abusive language, such as:

> F*** you

is never welcome.  The same goes for personal attacks like the following:

> It's obvious you're a troll.

Snide comments, like the following:

> You really haven't comprehended anything I'm saying.

are generally unhelpful.  What you could have said:

> I think perhaps my point was unclear.  Let's rehash:

## (2) Be Courteous

 Whether posting to a mailing list, or submitting a bug report we value your
 contribution to Scala. When working with another’s work, be courteous and
 professional. It’s not courteous to demand responses, insult pull requests
 or post condescending bug reports. In that same vein, avoid posting messages
 with little to no content on the mailing list. We have a lot of people in
 the community, let’s keep our signal to noise ratio high, and set emotions
 aside before coming to the table.

## (3) Be Excellent

Strive to improve in all things. Strive to better Scala, and improve
understanding. Improve your own teaching styles. Change the way we think about
code design. Scala is a gateway into a new world of software design, and we’re
constantly learning new things and opening new avenues. Keep an open mind
to try new things, and strive to improve what we already know.

## (4) Be Thorough

No matter what it is, responding to a question, fixing a bug, writing a
proposal, make sure the contribution is thorough. Don’t leave things half
written or half done. While the evolution of Scala is a continual process,
incomplete work is often of negative benefit. At the same time, contributors
will come and go, as with any open source community. If a contributor needs
to drop something, take measures to ensure someone else is willing to pick
it up, or notify the other maintainers.


## Violating the Code

If a community member refuses to abide by the Code of Conduct, via
personal attacks, abusive language or snide comments, then the following
actions will be taken:

1. **Issued a warning** On the first offense, one of the Scala moderators will issue a warning about the unacceptable behavior.
2. **Put under moderation** On the second offense, a user may be placed under moderation.  This will continue for a maximum of three months.  If behavior improves, a user can leave moderated status.   If behavior degrades, it can lead to #3.
3. **Removal from community** If a user has already been placed under moderation and returned, or has not learned to be respectful and courteous to others, it will constitute a removal from the Scala community, including all forums the Scala moderators are responsible for.
