title: The Scala Code of Conduct
---

This Code of Conduct covers our behaviour as members of the Scala Community,
in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, hackathon, public
meeting or private correspondence.  Scala moderators  are appointed by EPFL /
Typesafe to maintain the health of the community and will arbitrate in any
dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.

The code of conduct consists of a few simple rules:

## (1) Be Respectful

The Scala community is made up of a diverse set of individuals and
backgrounds. Everyone can make a contribution to Scala. Disagreement is no
excuse for poor behavior. Also, many users coming to Scala might have
different background than others. Not knowing a particular domain is not just
cause for rude behavior. On the flip side, if someone is suggesting concepts
that go beyond your basic understanding, patiently asking for more information
is the right way to go. In all interactions, treat each other with respect.

## (2) Be Courteous

 Whether posting to a mailing list, or submitting a bug report we value your 
 contribution to Scala. When working with another’s work, be courteous and 
 professional. It’s not courteous to demand responses, insult pull requests 
 or post condescending bug reports. In that same vein, avoid posting messages 
 with little to no content on the mailing list. We have a lot of people in 
 the community, let’s keep our signal to noise ratio high, and set emotions 
 aside before coming to the table.

## (3) Be Excellent

Strive to improve in all things. Strive to better Scala, and improve
understanding. Improve your own teaching styles. Change the way we think about
code design. Scala is a gateway into a new world of software design, and we’re
constantly learning new things and opening new avenues. Leave your mind open
to try new things, and strive to improve what we already know.

## (4) Be Thorough

No matter what it is, responding to a question, fixing a bug, writing a
proposal, make sure the contribution is thorough. Don’t leave things half
written or half done. While the evolution of Scala is a continual process,
incomplete work is often of negative benefit. At the same time, contributors
will come and go, as with any open source community. If you need to drop
something, take measures to ensure someone else is willing to pick it up, or
notify the other maintainers.


## Violating the Code

If certain unruly individuals refuse to abide by the Code of Conduct, via
personal attacks, abusive language or snide comments, then the following
actions will be taken:

1. **Issued a warning** On the first offense, one of the Scala moderators will issue a warning about the unacceptable behavior.
2. **Put under moderation** On the second offense, a user may be placed under moderation.  This is a limited time deal.  If behavior improves, a user can leave moderated status.   If behavior degrades, it can lead to #3.
3. **Removal from community** If a user has already been placed under moderation and returned, or has not learned to be respectful and courteous to others, it will constitute a removal from the Scala community, including all forums the Scala Team is responsible for.

## The Mailing Lists

The Scala mailing lists are split into several sub-lists:
- **scala-user** This is a mailing list for beginners/users of scala. No question is a dumb question on Scala user. No a priori knowledge of math, functional programing, java, or other topics should be assumed on this list. Any question can and should receive a courteous and insightful answer.
- **scala-debate** This is the ‘anthing goes’ list. You can bring up any issue, any topic, even heated ones. While professional courtesy and respect must be maintained, this is where discussion on controversial topics can occur, or “what-if” type questions.
- **scala-internals** This is the list relating to compiler/library development. If you’re into the actually day-to-day nuts and bolts of jenkins, pull requests and compiler bugs, this is the place to hang out. New implementations are discussed here, after being proposed to the general public.
- **scala-language** This list is for questions relating to the language itself and its specification. This includes deep topics like “Why do implicits work this way” or “What does Foo extends Any mean?”
- **scala-sips** This list is for collaboration and feedback regarding actively developed new features for Scala.   A SIP includes both the proposal process, as well as the implemenetation and integration into scala core.   If you want to see what’s coming down the pipe and you’d like to be involved, this is the mailing list for you.
- **scala-tools** This list is specifically for tooling around Scala, such as emacs, maven, ant and gedit. If you have a question, this may be the right list for you.
- **scala-announce** This list is for announcements only. All posts are moderated.
