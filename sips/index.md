# Welcome #

This is the landing page for the Scala Improvement Process (SIP) and the
Scala Library Improvement Process (SLIP).

The SIP process replaced the older SID (Scala Improvement Document) process,
however the old completed SID documents are still available to review in the
[completed section of the SIP list](sip-list.html).

## SIPs

SIPs are for changes to the Scala language and/or compiler and are subject to a
[rigorous review process](./sip-submission.html) and are usually accompanied by
changes to the [Scala language specification](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf),
lots of review and discussion on
the [scala-internals](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-internals) mailing list
and voting/approval milestones. Please read
[Submitting a SIP](./sip-submission.html) and our [SIP tutorial](./sip-tutorial.html) for
more information.

## SLIPs

For changes and additions to the Scala core libraries (i.e. those distributed
with the main scala-lang download), a still rigorous (yet less demanding) process
called the Scala Library Improvement Process (SLIP) exists.

SLIPs are intended for any library addition or modification that does not require
associated changes to the Scala language or compiler.

[Submitting a SLIP](./slip-submission.html) covers the process, and the
[SIP tutorial](./sip-tutorial.html) has information on how to write and format
your SLIP document.

Logistically, SLIPs share a lot of infrastructure with SIPs, including sharing the
[SIP mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-sips).
