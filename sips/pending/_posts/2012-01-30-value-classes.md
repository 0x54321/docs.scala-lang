title: SIP-15 - Value Classes

vote-status: accepted
vote-text: This is in Accepted status.  There is concern for numerical computing.  We think future SIP(s), using work from SIP-15, can provide more benefit to numerical computing users. The SIP as it exists benefits all users of implicit enrichment classes, and takes us much further to unboxed high performance code. This SIP does not exclude further work towards improving numerical computing in Scala.
